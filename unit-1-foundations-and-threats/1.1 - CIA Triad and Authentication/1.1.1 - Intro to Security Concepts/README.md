# 1.1.1 Intro to Security Concepts

## Lesson Objective(s):
- Identify the key goals and frameworks of Cybersecurity
- Identify the CIA triad as the characteristics of information
- Identify the state of information as stored, transmission, and processing

## Guiding Question(s):
- How does the protection of the CIA triad lead to the security of data?

### Lecture Notes
> From the course notes reviewed in class, take note on the material from this lesson as it relates to the Lesson Objectives and Guiding Question(s):

... Cybersecurity is about protecting you from digital attacks and accidents. There is a lot of job demand - 0 to 1% unemployment projected for next 10 years. 

The pay is very good even at the beginning of your career. Entry Level pay - 50k - some jobs start 100k. Pay ranges are around 300k

Notes: Model Of Computer Security 
Protection = prevention + (Detectition + Response)
Projecttion - What the goal is 
Prevention - What you can do ahead of time. 
Detection - What you can do while the system is running to determine if something is wrong
Response - When something wrond is detecyed what you can do to fix the problem.
Every security technique falls into at least one of the three elements of this equation.

CIA TRIAD: 
1. Condidentiality
A. Data is not reaveled. 
2. Integrity
A. Data is intact - not modified or corrupted.
3. Availability
A. Data is accessible to allowed users. 

Notes: Data "states"
TO prorect the CIA of data, we need to know what "state" the data is in and then we can apply the right cybersecurity tool. 
Data at rest = Storage information is at rest; usually files, databases, etc stored on hard rives, USB drives, memory, DVDS
Data in Transit = trasnmission being moved from one system to another or f ile sharing on a LAN or transfer on the Internet, etc. 
Data in Use = processing file creation by uzser, data used in an application, being processes or plaved in memory, etc. 

Notes: Breach of CIA examples
Loss of Confidentiality
Stolen data that was made in public

- NSA leaks of government data by Edward Snowden 

Notes: Breach of CIA examples
Loss of Integrity 
Data that was corrupted

- STUXNET worm - changed the code on centrifuge machines in an Iranian nuclear facility so that they ran too high 

Notes: Breach of CIA examples
Loss of Availability
Data is inaccessible
A common reason is a DDoS attack = Distributed Denial of Service

- Mirai Botnet takes down

...

3 A's 
1. Authentication = prove who you are
2. Access Control = what you are allowed to see or get (aka: authorization or permission)
3. Accounting = keep track of what you've done and what has happened (aka: auditing)
